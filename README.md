# mnist-digit-recognition
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using Deep Learning (CNN) with the MNIST dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on handwritten digit images and deployed as a web app using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and get predictions.
